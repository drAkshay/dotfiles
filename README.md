Dotfiles
========

This repository includes all of my custom dotfiles. They should be cloned to your home directory so that the path is **~/dotfiles/**. The included setup script creates symlinks from your home directory to the files which are located in **~/dotfiles/**.

The setup script is smart enough to back up your existing dotfiles into a **~/dotfiles_old/** directory if you already have any dotfiles of the same name, as the dotfile symlinks being created in your home directory.

So, to recap, the install script will:

1. Back up any existing dotfiles in your home directory to **~/dotfiles_old/**
2. Create symlinks to the dotfiles in **~/dotfiles/** in your home directory



Installation
------------

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/drAkshay/dotfiles ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
./makesymlinks.sh
```

**NOTE**: Please be sure to replace my **gitconfig** file with yours, unless you want me to get credit for all your work on your github repos :).

**PS**: This has been copied from https://github.com/michaeljsmalley/dotfiles for most part.
With the exception of **gitconfig**,**emacs.d**,**tmux**
